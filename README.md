Find the Sunbet ID and Broadcast Address providing the ip address and mask

Entire networks are usually too large to assign them in a particular LAN, even for big enterprises, therefore we usually chop these networks into smaller pieces called subnets. Subnets have many benefits, but sometimes may not be trivial to find the subnet ID for a specific host. In this article, I show you a small subnet ID calculator. This calculator can determine the subnet ID and the broadcast address providing an IP address and a mask.
